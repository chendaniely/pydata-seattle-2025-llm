Hello! Welcome to your Titanic data dashboard. I'm here to help you filter, sort, and analyze the data. Here are a few ideas to get you started:

* Explore the data
  * <span class="suggestion">Show me all smoking tables</span>
  * <span class="suggestion">Show only dinner patrons</span>
* Analyze statistics
  * <span class="suggestion">What is the average party size?</span>
  * <span class="suggestion">How many tables were served on Thursday?</span>
* Compare and dig deeper
  * <span class="suggestion">Which day had the highest tip percentage?</span>
  * <span class="suggestion">Show the tip distribution by day and time</span>

Let me know what you'd like to explore!
